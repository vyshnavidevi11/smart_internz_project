Unearthing the Environmental Impact of Human Activity: A Global CO2 Emission Analysis

Description:

Global warming is one of the biggest challenges currently being faced by the human race, although correlation is not causation, a likely cause of global warming is due to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide from human activities. CO2 Emission refers to the Carbon Dioxide emitted throughout the world. For this analysis we will be focusing on CO2 Emissions and its effect on the world we live in as well as some key factors and stats that may play a role in the emission of CO2 globally. Fossil fuel use is the primary source of CO2. The data throws light onto how much fossil fuels are burnt, per year per nation, which amounts to an increase in CO2 every year. This will help researchers and environment experts to predict global warming. So countries should set a goal to decrease this amount yearly.

Analysing Global Co2 Emission across countries from 1975 to 2020. This dataset contains a record of Co2 Emission by each Country and Region of Earth, here we are going to analyse and visualise Country wise, Region wise and Overall Co2 Emission on Earth.
